# OverThink Blog Website

This repository contains assignment 1 which is make multi-page website using html and css. I built a simple two-page blog website using plain HTML and CSS to show that I can organize content, style it cleanly, and keep things consistent across pages.

## Pages Included
- `home.html` – Contain Header with nav bar includes home and post buttons and socail media icons, Main with horizontal and vertical layouts and grids and Footer with additional contact and info.
- `post.html` – Sample article page with author info, images,etc.

### What I Focused On
- Fixed header with navigation buttons that keep the same look on both pages.
- Clean layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Clear typography, subtle gradients, and consistent spacing.
